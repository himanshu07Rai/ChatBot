const responses: Record<ResponseKeys, string> = {
    "Who are you?": `**Personal Assist ants :** Voice - activated assistants like Siri , Google Assistant , and Alexa for tasks and information .
  **Smart Home Devices :** Automation and control of home systems such as lighting , thermostat , and security .
  **Recommendation Systems :** Personalized content and product suggestions on platforms like Netflix and Amazon .
  **Navigation and Traffic Management :** GPS services providing real -time traffic updates and route optimization .
  **Health Monitoring :** Wear able devices tracking fitness and health metrics , often integrated with AI for personalized advice`,
  
    "What is AI?": `**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. This field encompasses various subfields, including:
      - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that enable computers to learn from data.
      - **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.
      - **Computer Vision**: Enabling machines to interpret visual information.
      - **Robotics**: Designing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks.
      AI can analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention, revolutionizing industries such as **healthcare**, **finance**, and **transportation**.`,
  
    "What is Node.js?": `**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Key features include:
      - Built on **Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine**.
      - Ideal for creating **scalable network applications**.
      - Uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture** for efficient request handling.
      This makes Node.js particularly suitable for building **real-time applications** like chat systems and online gaming.`,
  
    "Tell me a joke": `Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was **outstanding in his field**!
      This joke is a pun that plays on the double meaning of "outstanding"â€”referring both to being excellent and literally standing out in a field. Humor often relies on clever wordplay to elicit laughter.`,
  
    "What are the applications of AI in daily life?": `AI is integrated into many aspects of our daily lives, often in ways we may not realize. Examples include:
      - **Virtual Assistants**: Siri and Alexa managing our schedules.
      - **Smart Home Devices**: Automating daily tasks.
      - **Recommendation Algorithms**: Streaming services suggesting products based on our preferences.
      In **healthcare**, AI systems assist in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images, while in **finance**, they help in fraud detection and algorithmic trading, showcasing the versatility and transformative power of AI across various sectors.`,
  
    "What is the future of technology?": `The future of technology promises significant advancements in areas such as:
      - **AI**: Increased automation across industries.
      - **Quantum Computing**: Solving complex problems beyond current capabilities.
      - **Biotechnology**: Improvements in personalized medicine driven by genetic insights.
      As we advance, **ethical considerations** around privacy, security, and the impact of technology on employment will be crucial in shaping a future where technology benefits all of humanity.`,
  
    "How does machine learning work?": `**Machine learning** is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms allowing computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. The process typically involves:
      - Feeding large datasets into a model.
      - Identifying patterns and relationships.
      This can be:
      - **Supervised Learning**: Training on labeled data.
      - **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering patterns without explicit instructions.
      Over time, the model improves its accuracy by adjusting based on new data, making machine learning a powerful tool for tasks ranging from **image recognition** to **natural language processing**.`,
  
    default: `I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for that. However, I'm constantly learning and evolving. If you have a different question or if there's a specific topic you'd like to explore, please feel free to ask!`,
