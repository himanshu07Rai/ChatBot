const responses = {
  "Who are you?": `I am an **AI-powered virtual assistant** designed to help you navigate through your questions and provide information across a wide range of topics. My primary goal is to assist you in finding the answers you seek while ensuring a pleasant interaction experience.`,

  "What is AI?": `**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. This field encompasses various subfields, including:
    - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms that enable computers to learn from data.
    - **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language.
    - **Computer Vision**: Enabling machines to interpret visual information.
    - **Robotics**: Designing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks.
    AI can analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention, revolutionizing industries such as **healthcare**, **finance**, and **transportation**.`,

  "What is Node.js?": `**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Key features include:
    - Built on **Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine**.
    - Ideal for creating **scalable network applications**.
    - Uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture** for efficient request handling.
    This makes Node.js particularly suitable for building **real-time applications** like chat systems and online gaming.`,

  "Tell me a joke": `Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was **outstanding in his field**!
    This joke is a pun that plays on the double meaning of "outstanding"â€”referring both to being excellent and literally standing out in a field. Humor often relies on clever wordplay to elicit laughter.`,

  "What are the applications of AI in daily life?": `AI is integrated into many aspects of our daily lives, often in ways we may not realize. Examples include:
    - **Virtual Assistants**: Siri and Alexa managing our schedules.
    - **Smart Home Devices**: Automating daily tasks.
    - **Recommendation Algorithms**: Streaming services suggesting products based on our preferences.
    In **healthcare**, AI systems assist in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images, while in **finance**, they help in fraud detection and algorithmic trading, showcasing the versatility and transformative power of AI across various sectors.`,

  "What is the future of technology?": `The future of technology promises significant advancements in areas such as:
    - **AI**: Increased automation across industries.
    - **Quantum Computing**: Solving complex problems beyond current capabilities.
    - **Biotechnology**: Improvements in personalized medicine driven by genetic insights.
    As we advance, **ethical considerations** around privacy, security, and the impact of technology on employment will be crucial in shaping a future where technology benefits all of humanity.`,

  "How does machine learning work?": `**Machine learning** is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms allowing computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. The process typically involves:
    - Feeding large datasets into a model.
    - Identifying patterns and relationships.
    This can be:
    - **Supervised Learning**: Training on labeled data.
    - **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovering patterns without explicit instructions.
    Over time, the model improves its accuracy by adjusting based on new data, making machine learning a powerful tool for tasks ranging from **image recognition** to **natural language processing**.`,
